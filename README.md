### Clusterization of AI-Synthesized Voices using Bispectral Analysis and Dimensionality Reduction

***Abstract — With the recent advances in voice synthesis, AI-synthesized speeches are indistinguishable to human ears andare widely applied to produce realistic and natural DeepFakes,exhibiting useful applications, but also creating real threats toour society. This paper proposes the use of bispectral analysisand statistical tools to create features capable to catch thedifference between human and synthesized voices. We showthat is possible to visually distinguish the clusters of humanand synthesized voices by inspecting a 2-D plot constructedusing a dimentional reduction technique.***
